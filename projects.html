				I often struggle to define what I do. A more manageable answer often becomes what I’m
				working on at any given time. If you haven’t checked out my
				<a href="https://github.com/williamwmarx/.dotfiles/blob/main/personal/.plan">.plan</a>
				file yet, that’s probably a good place to start. I update it daily, so check the commit
				history for that file to see changes in what I’ve been working on over time. As a matter of
				principle, I try to do both some hard science/engineering work and more
				reflective/creative work daily. Much of this doesn't make it into the .plan file, but I try
				to chronicle all that is measurable.

				Titles are strange, but I work to earn that of “artist”. And as we know, every artist needs
				a studio. Mine is called <a href="https://atemp.studio">A-TEMP®</a>. It's a name that stands
				for many things, “After Temporary” being its primary expansion. Others possible expansions
				include after temps (time, [FR]), artificial temporary, artificial time, and so on... it
				may even be a crude attempt to spell, well, attempt. Like everything I do, the studio's
				name is an extension of others’ work. If you don't know the reference, hit my line and I'll
				tell you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Like any good corporation, A-TEMP® has its subsidiaries. What would Coke be without Diet
				Coke? <a href="https://rrose.enterprises">RROSE ENTERPRISES</a> is my art practice.
				Something's Missing, LLC handles my design work and all collaborations. We have an in-house
				publisher in A-TEMP® Publishing and a technology and innovation wing called
				<a href="https://github.com/t3atemp">Turing Time Technologies</a>
				(t3 for short). Underneath it all, there exists an aspirationally great management operation
				called A-TEMP® Logistics. Oh, and we have an art store called
				<a href="https://gallery.marx.sh">“Curated Vacancy”</a>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Make no mistake, this is a studio in spirit, not in size. As of right now, I'm the only
				full-time member of A-TEMP®. While you’re reading this you’re a part of the team as well.
				Art is an exercise in communication. Without both a sender and receiver, we are left in
				stasis.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some of the things I work on don’t fall under the A-TEMP® umbrella. The prime example of
				this is <a href="https://cwdt.us">CWDT</a>, a research project run jointly by
				<a href="http://charlescrabtree.com/">Charles Crabtree</a> and myself.
