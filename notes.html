				This site uses
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics">Google Analytics</a>. It's
				something I don't like doing, but the curiosity of who's viewing this site and from where
				gets to me.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I probably won't ever get rid of analytics because of this, but as an act of good faith,
				I'll recommend two adblockers that'll stop me from collecting your data. If you're using
				Chrome (or a better, Chromium-based one like The Browser Company’s
				<a href="https://arc.net/">Arc</a> [what I use]) check out
				<a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlockOrigin</a>. It's good, it's free, and best of all,
				it's open source. Gotta love it. If you're using Safari or are reading this on an Apple
				product, make the upgrade to <a href="https://1blocker.com/">1Blocker</a>. It costs $3/mo.,
				but it's a great experience, constantly gets updated and can block iPhone apps from tracking
				you as well. Not getting paid by any of these people, just a fan of their products. 
			</p>

			<p>
				On desktop, I use a cookie to keep track of whether you're viewing the simplified homepage
				or the Windows-98-esque one. No other tracking is taking place, feel free to check out the
				site’s <a href="https://github.com/williamwmarx/marx.sh">source code</a>.
