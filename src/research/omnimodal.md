title: "Towards a better understanding of univariate omnimodal series"
papertype: "working"

At the heart of social science exists the necessity of understanding the data with which we work. The advent of big data has catalyzed a causal turn from measuring the effect of some X on some Y to acknowledging the need to realize data as a descriptive work. While this shift has introduced many new and useful methods, the three main statistics for univariate analysis — mean, median, and standard deviation — remain critically flawed. Taken together, these statistics seek to describe the nominal value or values of a given series. For unimodal distributions, these statistics may approximate nominal values reasonably well; but for multimodal distributions, they fall short, often classifying outliers as nominal values. To correct these flaws, I introduce two new statistics, and a non-parametric probability density function estimator from which they are derived, $\xi$. These statistics extend the logic of mean, median, and standard deviation, improving accuracy while being robust to modality. $\widehat{\xi}$, the modes of the $\xi$ function, replaces most use cases of means or medians. $\overline{\sigma}$, the mean deviation of each composite series from its respective mode, replaces the need for standard deviation. Finally, I introduce both Python and R packages to facilitate these statistics’ adoption.
